/**
 * Login throttling.
 *
 * Five bad passwords in a row used to cost an attacker nothing — no delay, no
 * lockout — on the customer login, the API and the admin panel alike. The admin
 * panel is the serious one: a public URL guarding the whole catalogue, customer
 * list and order history behind a single password.
 *
 * Two counters, deliberately:
 *
 *   by IP       stops one machine grinding through many usernames.
 *   by username stops a distributed attempt on one account.
 *
 * Counting only the username would let an attacker rotate usernames freely;
 * counting only the IP would let anyone lock a victim out from elsewhere. A
 * successful login clears that pair, so a legitimate person who mistypes twice
 * and then gets in is never punished for it.
